# Pico-NTP-Clock
Extended clock example for Pico W and Pico Display Pack 2.0 with NTP support in Micropython

## Prerequisites
- This makes use of the Pimoroni fork of Micropython
- This requires the `WIFI_CONFIG.py` file to be edited with your respective wifi network credentials
- Requires a Pico W for Wifi 

## Installation 
- Flash the latest version of the Pimoroni Micropython `.uf2` file onto the Pico W
- Transfer the code to the Pico W via your method of choice (I used Thonny for this)
- Configure your WIFI credentials in `WIFI_CONFIG.py`
- Run in your editor or plug into power source.
